/About Me

I'm Yaseen

An aspiring software develeoper and engineer with a passion for learning and problem solving. I love working on various projects and overcoming any hurdles that stand in my way.

I've been a teacher for the past 9 years and counting. One of my favourite aspects of teaching is the learning that I receive from engaging my students. Each one is unique and therefore each student requires a different teaching style.

I find myself having the same joy through coding, each language has its own benefits with a code to crack as they come together.
